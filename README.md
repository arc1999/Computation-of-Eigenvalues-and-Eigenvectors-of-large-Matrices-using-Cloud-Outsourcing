Computation-of-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-for-large-Matrices-using-Cloud-Outsourcing This project consist of a Comparision Model for Calculation of Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors of large Matrices on cloud and on a local System.The Aim of the Project was to Create a Secure Model for Outsourcing EVD to Cloud. The flow of execution of the codes is

run keygen.c first and enter the input Matrix and Encrypt it.

then run the calc.c to Calculate Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of encrypted Matrix.

then finally run vd.c to Verify & Decrypt the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the input Matrix.
